### News
Our paper "Model Distillation of Knowledge Transfer from Face Classification to Alignment and Verification" is accepted by NIPS 2017 workshop.

Our paper "How to Train Triplet Networks with 100K identities?" is accepted by ICCV 2017 workshop.

We got the champion of challenge1 (without external data) in MS-Celeb-1M in ICCV 2017!

Our single ResNet-50 model got the LFW accuracy of 99.65%!

### Biography
I got my PhD degree in 2015 from>National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition(NLPR), Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). My supervisor is Prof. Kaiqi Huang, and I am a member of Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC). I received the Master degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, particularly face recognition, large-scale training and model compression.
